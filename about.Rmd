## Background 
I was born and raised in Saigon, Vietnam. Torn between the past and present, I enjoy learning about and reading fictions on the post-war Vietnamese diaspora, as well as Vietnamese refugees/immigrants experience. Here are a couple books on this topic that I like. 

 - [The Sympathizer](https://www.amazon.com/Sympathizer-Novel-Pulitzer-Prize-Fiction-ebook/dp/B00PSSG4MM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3AWHZS7FANIC1&keywords=the+sympathizer&qid=1572631822&sprefix=the+sympa%2Caps%2C181&sr=8-1) by *Viet Thanh Nguyen*
