I was born and raised in Vietnam, attended Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY, where I did Economics and Chinese. I am now a first-year MS Biostatistics student at Columbia Mailman School of Public Health, hoping to understand the challenges in health care and hopefully contribute to alleviate those challenges in the near future. 

Here is my [resume](./Ngoc Duong_resume.pdf)
